This error occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a local URI that doesn't exist or is incorrectly formatted.  This can happen due to typos, incorrect file paths, or issues with asset handling within Expo's asset system.  The error message itself is often not very descriptive, leading to debugging challenges.  It might manifest as a blank space where the image should be, or a generic network error.
